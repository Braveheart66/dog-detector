# Dog Detection

Dog Detection is a Python project powered by TensorFlow for detecting dogs in images.  
This repository provides scripts and models for building, training, and running dog detection using deep learning.

## Features

- Detects dogs in images using TensorFlow.
- Easy to train and deploy.
- Modular codebase for experimentation.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Braveheart66/dog-detection.git
    cd dog-detection
    ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

- Add your training and test images to the appropriate directories.
- Train your model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
- Run dog detection on new images:
    ```bash
    python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
    ```

## Testing

- Run tests (if you have a `tests/` folder and use `pytest`):
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
